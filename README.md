📝 Handwriting Recognition Web App

A simple web app that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using TensorFlow.js. This project was built and tested on Chrome OS using CodePen.

🚀 Features:

🖊️ Draw a digit (0-9) on a canvas

🤖 Uses a pre-trained MNIST model for digit recognition

📊 Displays the predicted number with confidence scores

📱 Supports both mouse and touch inputs

🔥 Runs entirely in the browser (No installations required!)

📂 Project Structure:

/handwriting-recognition  
│── index.html   # Main UI (Canvas & Buttons)  
│── style.css    # Page Styling  
│── script.js    # TensorFlow.js Logic & Prediction  
│── README.md    # Project Documentation

-Draw a number and click "Predict" to test!

🛠️ Technologies Used:

HTML5 – For creating the UI

CSS3 – For styling the page

JavaScript – For logic and event handling

TensorFlow.js – For loading and running the ML model


🎯 How It Works:

1️⃣ User draws a number on the canvas
2️⃣ Canvas image is converted into grayscale (28x28 pixels)
3️⃣ TensorFlow.js model processes the image
4️⃣ Model predicts the digit and displays the result

🚀 Future Improvements:

🎨 Better UI – Add a more polished design

🖼️ Custom Model – Train a new model for improved accuracy

🔢 Multi-Digit Support – Recognize more than one digit at a time
